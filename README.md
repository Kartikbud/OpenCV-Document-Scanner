OPENCV DOCUMENT SCANNER

- Created this project using C++ library OpenCV
- Takes images as an input and processes them as needed to calculate the edges of the page. Then uses the warp function in OpenCV to warp the perspective of an image of the paper to a birdseye view of the paper
- To change the page being scanned, a new file should be placed into the assets folder, and the path to the file should be modified accordingly within the code
- The scanner works best for A4 paper, but the width and height can be changed in the code to accomodate different sizes of paper
